Respiratory for videos made with Manim

I am by no means a programmer, I only know the very basics but do find it highly entertaining and very useful. I also find that sharing and open-source are the way for an amateur like me since I have a great benefit of seeing how others code. And since Grant Anderson has been so kind to make his Manim open-source I only find it fitting to share the creations that I make.

That being said. There are probably a way smarter way of programme the scripts that I have so if you find it worthy of your time I am always eager to learn.

All the best.
